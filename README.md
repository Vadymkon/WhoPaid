# whopaid

The company gathered in a restaurant. We ordered food, but someone does not eat something, which means they are not going to pay for it. And there are several such people and positions at once. How do you count and divide? Very difficult. It is for such cases that WhoPaid was created. Mark those positions that the person ate, and get the correct split check for each.
Fun: Different themes in the settings, localization and more shots there.
